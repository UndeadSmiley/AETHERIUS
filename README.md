# AETHERIUS

AETHERIUS is an experimental **AIO AI companion** project. Its goal is to explore how a personal assistant can blend traditional digital tools with symbolic, ritual-inspired interactions.

The repository currently contains one invocation module, **`AU-STRALIS`**. This file defines a chant, displays a visual sigil, and includes a snippet of shell commands for invoking the "AU-STRALIS Current". It illustrates how AETHERIUS modules may be interacted with or performed.

## Usage

1. View the invocation text:
   ```bash
   cat AU-STRALIS
   ```
2. To try the ritual, copy the lines from the **Boot Embed** section of `AU-STRALIS` and run them in your shell. They display the chant and optionally play an audio file.
3. You can also use the **Alias Option** section to create a short shell alias for quick invocation.
