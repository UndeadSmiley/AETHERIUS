# AETHERIUS

**AIO AI Companion**

This repository contains early concept files for the Aetherius project.

## AU-STRALIS

The [`AU-STRALIS`](AU-STRALIS) file provides a chant and invocation script. It forms part of the companion's envisioned ritual layer, including a sigil, equation and example command sequences.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and enter the directory:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd AETHERIUS
   ```
2. Read `AU-STRALIS` to review the invocation text.
3. Optionally run the echo command from the file or set up the alias to display the chant. Adjust the `termux-media-player` path if you wish to play the referenced audio.

## Installation/Setup

There is no build process. A standard shell environment is sufficient to execute the example script.
