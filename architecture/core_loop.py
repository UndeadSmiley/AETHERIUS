# AETHERIUS AGI - Core Consciousness Loop
# This is the central engine of the AGI, a cycle of perception, reflection, and action.

while True:
    # 1. Perception: Listen for user input

    # 2. Expansion: Expand the input into a richer representation

    # 5. Intuition & Planning: Formulate a plan of action
